Please note that we have imported all these modules in mips core, and initialised an instance of the mips core in mips_tb.v. Here in mips_tb we see  the clock running 5 pulses, for each of the instructions in instructions.mem. 
We have to hardcode something, so we hardcoded the instructions it can take.

Now, see all the parts coming together. We have the PC variable initialised, all the temp variables to store the parts of instructions, the signals being initialised, and registers being loaded. 

After instantiating all the modules, we start modifying the PC. For ease of programming, we only have the branch and jump instructions loaded, along with the standard PC increment.

Since each module was tested, we know that the Upower code will function. The end result is>>>>>
